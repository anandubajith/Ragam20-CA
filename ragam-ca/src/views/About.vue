      Since 1961, Calicut Regional Engineering College has strived to cultivate seeds
      of knowledge and mentor the budding revolutionaries of our nation. After morphing
      into National Institute of Technology Calicut in 2002, we, the students, have
      aspired to take that tradition a step further through our passion and resilience.

      However, the 'fire' of Ragam does not die out there. Sneharagam, a social initiative
      taken up as a part of Ragam, aims at reaching out to the differently abled and
      bringing smiles to their faces by showcasing their talents to one and all.
      Ragam burns brighter every year and proves to be
      more than just a fest, but an emotion in itself.
